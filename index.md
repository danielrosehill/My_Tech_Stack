# My Tech Stack & Recommendations

## Purpose Statement

A list of tools that I use and recommend.

In contract with previous versions, this is a very cut-and-dried update to the repo.

Categories are markdown documents and I jot down a few notes if I have any useful recommendations to share!

## Recommendations By Type

 - [Linux OSes](/categories/linuxos.md)
 - [Mice & pointing devices](/categories/mice.md)
