# My Personal Technology Stack (Updated ... Sometimes)

I created this repository to host a periodically-updated list of my favorite tech products spanning pretty much all domains of use.

Here and there I add a few notes!

## OS

**Ubuntu Linux (LTS releases)**

I've been using Linux as my day to day OS for more than 15 years!

I've spent my fair share of time distro-hopping and have run Debian, Gentoo, Arch (among others) at different times.

But over time I've come to prefer a reliable LTS Ubuntu distro as the backbone of my system.

## Desktop environment

**LXDE**

When I started using Linux I was a poor student without a lot of disposable income.

LXDE allowed me to run Ubuntu on old hardware as if it were brand spanking new. Even though I finally own a desktop computer with some decent firepower in it, I've been using LXDE for so long that it's an impossible habit to break!

I played around with tiling window managers for a period (they're cool). But I think that LXDE strikes a happy medium between usability and minimalism (every time I use Windows or even Unity I'm blown away by how bloated the DEs are with graphic effects and the like)
