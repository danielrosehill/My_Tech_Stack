# Linux OS Recommendations

### Fedora Linux

I used Ubuntu Linux for almost 20 years (!) before moving over to Fedora in 2024. 

I use KDE Plasma which I find the most pleasant desktop environment to interact with.

### Pros:

- I think Fedora strikes an excellent balance between usability and functionality 
- I like the fact that Fedora is slightly more conservative when it comes to security than other Linux distros
- Overall, love the design of KDE Plasma. It has elevated my daily computing experience enormously compared to LXDE!
-  Fedora is a popular distro choice among the scientific and data communities in particular

### Cons:

- Compared to Debian, it can be a little harder to find support
- There are weird issues around codec licensing that I was not expecting
-  Wayland seems to bring with it lots of complications. I still haven't figured out how to get OBS to work
-  
## Overall Linux OS Thoughts

Occasionally, a (non-technical) friend will ask me what Linux distro I'd recommend to a total beginner. Ubuntu is still my recommendation.

But personally, I'm very happy to have made the shift over to Fedora and overall it's been a very positive experience.
